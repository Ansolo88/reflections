How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It makes spoting faults much easier!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I don't know yet for sure. But I can imagine, that it might be quiet
    helpfull in certain situations! For example if you had an idea, but
    after some time you recognize that your former idea was better, you can
    easily switch back to your older version of the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can choose the amount of changes between two commits by yourself...

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I really don't care!

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    - 'git log' allows me to see all verions of a repository, each with an unique ID.
    - 'git diff' allows me to easier find differences (lines added or deleted) between
      two file-versions.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
